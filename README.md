# libCRT

Library for processing data from Cosmic Ray Taggers, build by University of Bern.
Includes data containers, reconstruction methods and event display.
The project contains yet several ad-hoc hardcoded parameters, so do not expect that it will just work when you install it.
It will need customisation.
